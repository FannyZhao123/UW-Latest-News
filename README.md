# UW-Latest-News

Introduction of My UW Latest News:

1. The web client used the News endpoint to retrieve the latest UW news.

2. There are three filters in my web client, which are News Title, News ID and News site.
  Where News Title and News ID are text-based filters,
  and News site is a non text-based filter (implemented with a dropdown selection box).

3. By typing in the related text and select different site that provided, and press Search button,
  you can get related information about the News.

4. If there is no such a news exist, it will output "No such NEWS exist! Please try others!"

5. You can keep searching without refresh the web page, all filtered data will store at the page.
